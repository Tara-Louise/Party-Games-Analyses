# Party-Games-Analyses
A look into the party game genre to help them win a remaster of an old Party Game to Microsoft!

Overview

This project contains a set of interactive Tableau dashboards built to analyse the party-game market, focusing on platform distribution, revenue performance, and peak player engagement.
The goal of the analysis is to provide clear, data-driven insights that help identify market opportunities, especially around monetisation models, platform expansion, and potential franchise growth.

These dashboards were created using:

Cleaned and pre-processed datasets

External market data (SteamDB, publisher reports, press releases, industry benchmarks)

Tableau Public for final visualisation and analysis

# Dashboards Included
# 1. All-Time Peak CCU (Concurrent Users)

Shows the lifetime highest CCU for each comparable title, using real dates and peak concurrency data.
Purpose: Understand true market demand and the scale of breakout hits.

# 2. Platform Comparison

A visual heat-grid showing which platforms each title released on (PC, Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, Mobile).
Purpose: Identify gaps and opportunities in platform coverage — especially Mobile expansion, which remains under-served in this category.

# 3. F2P Revenue Benchmarks

Compares lifetime revenue for leading Free-to-Play live-service games with:

Battle passes

Cosmetic stores

Seasonal content

Purpose: Demonstrate how full monetisation stacks correlate with significantly higher lifetime earnings.

4. Paid Game Revenue Benchmarks

Visual comparison of lifetime revenue for traditional paid titles (non-F2P).
Purpose: Highlight the financial gap between paid games and fully monetised F2P live-service games, helping justify F2P/Hybrid models.

# Data Sources

All datasets were compiled from publicly available information, including:

SteamDB (peak CCU, platform availability)

SteamSpy (owner ranges)

Press releases & studio revenue announcements

Industry reporting (Sensor Tower, VG Insights, publisher statements)

Internal cleaning & estimation models where exact figures were not public

All data is approximate but grounded in credible public sources.

# Tools & Workflow

Tableau Public — dashboard creation

Python / Pandas — cleaning raw CSV data

Excel — intermediate formatting

LLM-supported analysis — shaping insights & checking interpretations

# What This Project Demonstrates

Ability to turn messy market data into clean, structured datasets

Production of clear and visually consistent dashboards

Understanding of live-service monetisation models

Skills in F2P vs Paid market comparison

Strong analytical positioning for game strategy, product planning, and forecasting
